# Introduction

So, you're a movie writer looking for inspiration for your next project. The blank page can be pretty daunting, right? Don’t worry—we’ve got you covered. By harnessing the power of data analysis, we can uncover the next big trends in the movie industry together.

Cinema, though a relatively young art form, has been profoundly influenced by historical and sociological events. Could the thematic evolution of film serve as a mirror reflecting significant moments in history? How do major events shape cinematic trends? Which genres rise or fall in popularity during times of war or societal upheaval? Do action and drama films dominate, or do audiences gravitate toward escapist comedies during turbulent times? And are these trends periodic or long-lasting?

Join us on this analytical journey as we explore how pivotal societal events have influenced cinematic trends and shaped the popularity of different genres. We will characterize these trends to understand if determine whether they represent enduring shifts or fleeting peaks of popularity. Along the way, we’ll uncover  valuable insights into the next thematic wave of film releases, giving you the inspiration you need to pitch your next submission to producers—well before the deadline!

# History and Genre Trends 

First, let us take a look at all movie that have been released since the beginning of cinema. These movies are characterized by genres and a release date. These are the two parameters we will need for our study. Our first reflex would be to examine the temporal distribution of genres, and see if we can already see patterns there.

At this early point, there's already a couple of things we observe:

*   The rise of the “Musical” in the 1930s-1950s: This peak may coincide with the rise of Hollywood musicals after the Great Depression and during the Second World War, a period when entertainment was important.
*   The gradual decline of “Dramas” after 1940: This may be linked to a shift in public demand towards lighter or more spectacular genres (such as action and adventure).
*   The rise of “Thrillers/Suspense” and “Horror” after 1960-1980: May coincide with periods of social or political tension (Cold War, oil crisis). 
*   The rise of Action films from the 1980s: This could be linked to technological advances in special effects and the rise of iconic heroes. 

So we have our motivation! We're asking ourselves the right questions it seems.

Now we also need to take a look at History. World history is paved by an endless amount of events. Navigating through all of them would be endless and much too complicated to handle. Moreover, and quite thankfully, not every country has made box-office contributions. We just need to identify a manageable selection of key events to explore their influence on cinematic trends and movie releases. Whether these events be good, "positive", bad, "negative", they will serve as the influencial keypoints driving the trends we hope to see in movie genres.

Now that we are equipped with the basic tools to begin our analysis, we can get into the heart of the matter.

Picking out the most important movie genres, let’s take a first look at the potential correlations between our historical events and their distribution. We are looking for major shifts in the prominence of genres after selected timepoints.

<img src="plot global plot.png" width="100%">

 Some events are followed with more significant changes than others, and already could hint at the possibility of an influence they have to the proportion of genres in movie releases. 

*  Comedy and Drama consistently dominate the overall genre distribution, regardless of the event period.

*  The proportions of action-related genres (Action and Adventure) tend to increase after certain events, possibly reflecting a cultural or societal shift toward escapism or hero-centric narratives.

*  Other genres, such as Musical and Horror, remain minor yet show specific spikes after certain events, suggesting a contextual influence.

Overall, for example, periods of conflict and upheavel seem to drive shifts toward action-oriented and reflective storytelling. 
So maybe it may not be such a bad idea to take a look at the news before you start writing. 

But we still have to try to understand the exact nature of the influence on the distribution of genres due to these events. Yes, major historical events do seem to be followed with some kind of change in the genres of films released at that time but how important is this change? Does it last more than a couple of years? Are the effects, if they are real effect, immediate or do that endure in the long term?

Because sure, you may find it a good idea to write a romance movie after the passage of laws on gay rights but will your movie be part of a short-lived trend?

It might be smart to focus in a few significant events and take a closer look at several specific case studies to reinforce our analysis.

# Immediate or long-lasting effect ?

Let us continue our historical analysis and cross-reference with variations in the film industry. Our goal is to determine whether such events lead to immediate, short-term spikes in the production of specific types of films or whether they contribute to long-term, sustained trends over time. By identifying these patterns, we aim to better understand the relationship between significant moments in history and their lasting impact on cinema. We want to make sure if it is worth the trouble of writing movies in such genres. 

Narrowing our focus to specific types of films through targeted case studies allows for more concrete insights and clearer conclusions. By examining these case studies, we can assess the influence on cinematic trends, determining whether this impact is periodic and short-lived or contributes to a sustained, long-term effect.

There are different types of events we can look into.
* Major historical events, at a specific time, which has a lasting impact on society
* Technological advancements, which usher great changes in the industry, such as advancements in visual effects, sound, and cinematography, which bring clear impacts on filmmaking trends
* Commercially successful hits, that may set new standards or inspire a wave of similar films
* Globalization and the opilical and economical openings towards other cultures
* Rise in cultural movements which reflect societal changes and may shape themes and narratives depicted in movies.

Because these "timepoints" are quite different in nature, surely they will reflect differing impacts on the cinema industry, and this is what we want to establish.


1. War Movies/ World War II

2. Propaganda movies/ World War II

3. WWII/ Film Noir

4. Rise of Musicals/ Great Depression

5. Political films/ Watergate scandal

6. Spy Movies/ Cuban Missile Crisis

7. Creature Movies/ Atomic Bomb

8. Crime Movies/ Prohibition in USA
